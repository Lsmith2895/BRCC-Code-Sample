        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Read the README:</strong> I started by thoroughly reading the README to understand the project's scope and requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Created GitHub Issues:</strong> To stay organized, I documented tasks as issues in GitHub, helping me track progress effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identified Key Technologies:</strong> After reading the README, I determined which technologies I needed to research to complete the issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Researched Apollo:</strong> I watched a <em>"Getting Started with Apollo"</em> video to familiarize myself with the framework.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Explored the Codebase:</strong> I navigated through the app, reviewing existing todos, comments, and the overall structure to understand how different components interact.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Created a High-Level Diagram:</strong> I mapped out how queries, mutations, and UI components interact with the database to visualize the system's architecture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Started Development:</strong> With a solid understanding in place, I worked through the GitHub issues one at a time ( doing any reseach along the way).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Created and Merged PRs:</strong> After completing each issue, I created a pull request (PR), carefully reviewed my own code, and performed UI checks (QA) to ensure everything functioned as expected. I documented the work done, tagged the relevant issue, and merged the PR after verification.
          </li>
